What do I do in the project and what is covered?

All of the data for this project was sourced from [Athlete First](athletefirst.org), a site dedicated to providing sprint splits and hurdle touchdown times as resources for athletes and coaches. The file I referenced can be found online [here](https://www.athletefirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mens-400m-Hurdles-by-athlete-20250520.pdf).
